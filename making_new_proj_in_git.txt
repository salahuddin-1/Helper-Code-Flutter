Making new project in GIT




1. Check if master repo exists remotely & if doesnâ€™t create a new branch named master
2. Create a new folder for that project (abc)
3. Go to abc through terminal 
4. git init
5. git add README.md
6. git commit -m "first commit"
7. git fetch
8. Checkout to master through your IDE or git checkout <remote-branch-name>
9.  Git push or git push set upstream
10. Now you checkout to the other branches from master and their parent will be master and copy and or make new files to that repo and push
