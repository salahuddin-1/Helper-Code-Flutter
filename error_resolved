1. Path Error 

App-specific directory on external storage
Starting on Android 11, apps cannot create their own app-specific directory on external storage (This means app’s Internal Storage)

It means u cannot create your own specified custom folder path like :

'/storage/emulated/0/Capital_Bank’ 

Here Downloads already comes define

'/storage/emulated/0/Download'
or
getExternalStorageDirectory();
