2. Open command prompt in that bin folder
3. Type this command
4. Change user name in path



keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\Users\yourusernamehere\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

Note : For getting your username navigate to C/Users and check in every user directory for .android folder
And if it is present in that directory that is the path.
